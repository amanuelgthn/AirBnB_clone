This Project tries to implement a simple copy of the AirBnb Website on self server.
For now It won't implement all the features that are fundamental to the website,only some of them required for the project and to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level of the higher level programming track.
Upon completion the web application will composed by:
	1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for   development and debugging)
	2. A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
	3. A database or files that store data (data = objects)
	4. An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
