Upon completion the web application will composed by:
	1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for   development and debugging)
	2. A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
	3. A database or files that store data (data = objects)
	4. An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
